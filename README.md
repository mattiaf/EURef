This repo includes the file used for creating the visualizations at www.mfumagalli.com/EURef/
where I analyze the flux of refugees in Europe, and in particular try to answer the following questions: 
_ What are their chances of getting asylum status granted?
_ Do those depend on the country of destination, their nationality, their age?
_ Which European countries accept more refugees? Is there any correlation with the economic situation of the countries itself?
_ Do refugees tend to go to countries where there is already a community of immigrants from their home nation?
